# IPM-Project: E.S.Ideal

# Grade: 19/20 ⭐

## Overview
This project implements a user interface for employees of ES.Ideal, a fictional service station with car workshops, 
using Vue.js for the frontend and json-server for simulating a backend API. This interface provides a central hub for
employees to manage various aspects of the service station's operations.

## Technologies Used
### **Frontend:** Vue.js 
### **Backend (Simulation):** json-server

### **Cors Everywhere**
In order to connect the _frontend_ and the _backend_ locally it´s necessary to include CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in _backend_ requests.
For security reasons, by _default_ the _browsers_ restrict HTTP _Cross origin_ requests initiated by scripts, to allow them for development purposes, you should use this [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/).
